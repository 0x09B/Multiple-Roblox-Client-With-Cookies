# Multiple Roblox Client Joiner With Cookies
 
Hello it's just an app that I got inspired by, so I made it in C#


What is the point of this app?
Let's say you have multiple Roblox accounts and you don't want to log in and join the game every time, all that you need get a cookie of the account and save all of them in a text document.

Example:</br>
Cookie1 </br>
Cookie2</br>
Cookie3</br>

After you open the text document, you need to set game id and how many clients do you want to launch

You are ready, just press Start :)

How the app does looks like: </br>
